        <h1 class="inr">INTRODUCTION</h1><br>
        <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 67);padding-left: 20px; font-size: 17px; padding-top: 0px;">A Non-Biodegradable material can be defined as a kind of substance which cannot be broken down by natural organisms and acts as a source of pollution.

            Unlike biodegradable wastes, non-biodegradable cannot be easily handled. Non-biodegradable wastes are those that cannot be decomposed or dissolved by natural agents. They remain on earth for thousands of years without any degradation. Hence, the threat caused by them is also more critical. A notable example is plastics which are a commonly used material in almost every field. To give these plastics a long-lasting effect, improved quality plastics are being put to use. This made them more temperature resistant and more durable even after use. Other examples are cans, metals, and chemicals for agricultural and industrial purposes. They are the main causes of air, water and soil pollution and diseases like cancer.
            
            Since non-biodegradable wastes are not Eco-friendly, they need to be replaced. As a part of the development of alternatives, scientists have brought forward many ideas like biodegradable plastics, etc. They incorporated some biodegradable materials with plastics and made them easily and rapidly degradable. But this is quite an expensive procedure.
