  <P style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; padding: 10px;"> Paper waste causes severe problems in so many offices and industries over the world. Due to printing mistakes, billings, junk mails, and packaging, such paper could comprise approximately 70% of the total waste of a 
    company. The recycling of paper is done by taking it to the recycling plant where it is firstly separated and then the separated paper is cleaned and washed with 
    soap in order for it to be broken down. After it is broken down, it is then exposed 
    to heat after which it breaks down into cellulose. Recycling is an essential method 
    to reduce pollution and cut back on waste accumulation. Notebooks, old newspapers, and used envelopes can be recycled. However, paper contaminated with 
    food, stickers, and carbon paper cannot be recycled.</P>
