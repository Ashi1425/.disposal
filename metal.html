   * Metal cans are impermeable to moisture, gases and light. They are produced from readily available and highly recyclable materials.<br><br>
   * Metal Cans means clean, empty metal containers made of aluminum or tin- plated or zinc-plated steel, which are commonly used for packaging food, beverages or other products, as specified by the Agency in the rules and regulations and are free of food, beverage or other contamination.
   <br><br>* metal cans are separated at the Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) by a magnet. The cans that have iron in them stick to the magnet and go on a different conveyor from the non-iron (aluminum) cans. The aluminum and tin cans get baled and trucked to a smelting plant.
   <br><br>* Scrap Metal PileAt the smelting plant, the cans get shredded and melted down into a molten liquid. The molten liquid looks similar to lava. The liquid metal is poured into a mold where it cools and hardens into a solid metal bar. These solid bars are sold to manufacturers who re-melt them and make their new metal products.</P>
