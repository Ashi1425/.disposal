        <h1 style="text-align: center;">FOOD WASTE</h1>
  <P style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; padding: 10px;">There is rapidly increasing attention given to sustainable food and 
    biodegradable waste management (FBWM) in the municipal solid waste management system, due to environmental challenges. The enormous amount of 
    FBW generated in Japan, for instance, is a result of their preference for raw food; 
    such as raw egg, raw vegetables, or raw fish or meat (sashimi, sushi, etc.). Fresh 
    fruits in particular, as well as other food, population growth, and improvement 
    in lifestyle and standards of living, have invariably introduced several logistical 
    problems that result in massive amounts of FBW [3, 4].
    Over the years, food and biodegradable waste have become a serious challenge 
    and concern for both the general public and the government [5–7]. However, this 
    waste presents a great opportunity if it is put to better use.
    It is worth noting that food waste constitutes a fraction of the biodegradable 
    waste which historically has gained less attention, in spite of the fact that it is the 
    most likely waste stream that could contaminate other waste fractions. Moreover, it has been the major contributor to methane production in landfill.

     <p style="padding-left: 20px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">How to recycle and reduce food waste at home !<br>
        * If you live in an area that has a local food waste recycling collection service, you can use this to dispose of anything you can't eat, or compost at home.<br>
        
        * A food waste caddy in your kitchen can help you to separate out your food waste for recycling and composting. This can be emptied into your compost bin or council food waste bin every couple of days.<br>
        
        * Your local authority may recommend that you line your food waste caddy with a liner or newspaper. Only use liners that are recommended by your council as some may not break down in the composting process.<br>
        
        * Where possible keep your bins out of direct sunlight and keep the bin lid closed.<br>
        
        * Only buy what you need and eat what you buy. For ideas, recipes and simple tips to help you reduce the amount of food you waste visit the Love Food Hate Waste website. You could also try to compost at home.</p>
