   * Toxic waste results from industrial, chemical, and biological processes. Toxins are found in household, office, and commercial wastes. Examples of common products that routinely become part of the toxic waste streams of industrialized countries include batteries for electronic devices, pesticides, cell phones, and computers.<br>
    <br>
   * Several social and ethical issues permeate the discussion of toxic waste. In countries with lax pollution regulations where polluters have no incentive to limit the disposal of toxins in the air, water, or landfills, negative externalities (costs imposed on society at large but not borne by the polluter) exist; such a shifting of costs raises fundamental questions of fairness. In countries with more stringent pollution regulations, toxic wastes may be dumped illegally, and some polluters may attempt to cover up that activity. </P>
